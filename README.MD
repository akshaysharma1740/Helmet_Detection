## **Project Overview**

This project implements a **helmet detection system** using **YOLOv8**, allowing detection of workers wearing or not wearing helmets. It supports:

- Training on custom helmet datasets
- Inference on test images
- Real-time webcam detection
- Web interface for image upload and prediction

---

## **Problem Statement**

1. Workplace safety in construction zones requires continuous monitoring of helmet usage.
2. Manual monitoring is time-consuming, error-prone, and cannot scale to large sites.
3. Existing automated solutions using simple image classification have:
   - Low precision and recall for workers without helmets
   - High false positives and false negatives
   - Inefficient handling of live video streams
4. There is a need for a robust, real-time helmet detection system that accurately detects helmet usage in dynamic and complex environments.

---

## **Solution**

The solution uses **YOLOv8 object detection**, which provides:

- **Accurate detection** of helmets with bounding boxes
- **Fast inference** on images and video streams
- **Web interface** for non-technical users to upload images
- **Real-time webcam detection** for live monitoring

**Key Improvements in This Project**:

1. **Custom-trained YOLOv8 model**: optimized for helmet detection.
2. **Inference module**: saves annotated images in a single output folder, avoiding unnecessary subfolders.
3. **Web upload & API**: users can upload images to get predictions immediately.
4. **Webcam detection**: outputs video with bounding boxes and warnings for missing helmets.
5. **Efficient outputs**: only necessary folders (`weights` and `annotated`) are created.
